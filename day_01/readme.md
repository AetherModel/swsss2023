## Let's set up our environment!

- Download and set up anaconda ( anaconda.com ).
- Make sure you have installed `git` `bash` and `python` (these should be default)

## Your `git` repository

- Set up a GitHub account (this is a good step in your career)
- Make a fork of the instructor's [SWSSS](https://github.com/AetherModel/swsss2023/) git repository.
- Clone your fork `git clone <your fork clone url here>`
- Create a new branch in your fork `git checkout -b personal`
