The general idea is to make a chemical scheme that will take the [O],
[O2], and [N2] densities and the thermospheric temperature and create
a time-dependent chemical scheme that will calculate [O+], [N2+],
[O2+], and [NO+].  The chemical equations are provided in the
chemistry_in_ionossphere.pdf.  Please note that the reaction rates
have units of cm (cm3/s or cm6/s) and NOT units of m (m3/s or m6/s),
so all of the rates need to be adjusted accordingly!!!

The team that is working on radiative transfer will ultimately provide
an ionization rate as a function of time, but we won't have this yet.
So, we will make something up to start. We will provide this on the
board.
