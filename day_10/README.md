##Projects

1. Make an accurate QEUV and calculate the thermospheric temperature and densities (O, O2, and N2) using a time-accurate solver.

2. Make a chemical scheme that will calculate O+, NO+, N2+, and O2+ using the densities and temperatures that you have calculated over the previous days. The scheme should be time-accurate and should be able to take a relatively large time-step (say >= 60s).

3. Both project should be able to:

3a. Download and use interpolation to get the F107 and 81-day average F107, which should determine the heating / ionization terms.

3b. Output data that you tell it at a cadence you tell it.

3c. Plot different data in different ways.  Some examples include: 2d contours of temperature vs time and altitude; line plots of temperature vs time; line plots of temperature vs altitude.  Users should be able to select a time range, the quantity to plot, and whether to plot the log of the variable.  Plot files should be appropriately named to allow the user to understand what is in the plot file.
