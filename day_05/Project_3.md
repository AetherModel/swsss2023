# Group Project 3: Storm detection and analysis
Description: In the project, the students will work together to analyze OMNI data and highlight the presence of storms.


## Task 1: Download the assignment file from day 2 and follow exercise 2
Go back on day 2 and solve exercise 2 of the assignments. Use the material uploaded by Chen and her examples as guidelines.

## Task 2: Improve your work
Repeat the exercise by creating a function where the user selects the week in 2013. Then, create a new function where the user decides the start and end date of a specific year.

## Task 3: Which week has the most events
Use your function to compare the number of events during each week of the year: display the results. Looking at Quasai's day 4 material, you can save figures for each week and create an animation that covers the whole year.

## Task 4: Analysis of the year 
Study the storm activity of the whole year. Identify minimum and maximum storm intensity, notifying the week of occurrence; the maximum and minimum time gap in between storms, notifying the relative week. Then, create a graph that compares the "numbers of storms in a week" vs "sum of the intensity of the storms in a week". 

## Task 5: Study storm activity for different seasons
Make the distribution of the minimum SML (AL) index that is identified for each event in different seasons. Then, try comparing the AL minimum (representing the substorm intensity) in different seasons. Create a function that asks for a specific season and displays the minimum SML.

## Task 6: Create your own tasks
Now that you worked with the data, which function do you think is needed? Which representation, according to you, gives the best representation for the number of storms? In the same way, you can repeat Task 1-2-3 for different years and give a visualization of how storms are changing in the long run. You are limited by your imagination, have fun!
